# Walmart-trip-type-classification
Walmart attempts to provide every customer the best shopping experience they can through segmentation of stores visits into different trip types. These trip types are created using a combination of “art” (preexisting customer insights) and “science” (historical purchase data). In this project, we aim to create a classification model and predict the trip types by focusing only on the data (“science”) using a training dataset available on Kaggle containing a much smaller set of features than what is used by Walmart. Walmart posted this project idea/challenge on Kaggle as they believe that their segmentation process would see refinement by improving the science behind trip type classification.
